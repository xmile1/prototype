// a heap is a specialized tree - based data structure that satisfies the heap property,
// Parent node is always greater than child - Max Heap    - smallest down and largest up
// Child is alwas greater than parent - Min heap   - smallest up and largest down.

// But the job it does is optimized algorithms by providing a means for efficient Min - Max of Lists and Arrays.

// In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue
