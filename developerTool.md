## GITFLOW WORKFLOW
The master branch stores the official release history, and the develop branch serves as an integration branch for features.


## MERGE vs REBASE

merge creates one commit the merges both branches

 rebasing re-writes the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch.
