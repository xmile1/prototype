//  Algorithm is a fancy name for step-by-step sets of operations to be performed.

// Big - O classify algorithms by how they respond to the number(N) of items that you give them.
// calculates the time complexity
// calculate the total memory it will require based on the Number of items




// Example of Tree Data Structure
// Items in folder
